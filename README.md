# Are points the most important factor when determining NBA champions?

This is the start of a research project to understand the most important factor in winning an NBA championship

So far this project has:
- scraped historical NBA information from a variety of sources, namely [Complete History Of The NBA](http://fivethirtyeight.com/interactives/the-complete-history-of-every-nba-team-by-elo), Basketball-Reference.com and Wikipedia
- compiled all information on historical scoring trends. 
- plotted the intitial findings

To be completed
- the creation of a dataset to be used for predicting a team's likelihood of winning the NBA championship at the end of the trade period.

Features ideas to be engineered:
- a ranking of teams based on aggregate player value.
- team GM success
- win/loss at the end of the trade period
- point differential
- number of home games to be played 
- number of away games to be played 
- distance of travel remaining in the season
